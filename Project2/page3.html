    <p>In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011) Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively generates sensual and informational presence." Similarly, when viewing old web pages in modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer of <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/cyberfest/index.htm">dated web-design aesthetics</a> overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions beneath. Pages optimised for lower resolutions now take <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/">than a third of the screen.</a> Ghosts of browsers past mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing images. Sound files play automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers who are not us.</p>
    <p>For example, M.D. Coverley’s <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/coverley/index.html">Personalization of Complexity (2001)</a> "explores the ways in which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only sometimes manageable by the owners." Fittingly, the piece itself warns that it is viewable only on Level 4 and 5 Microsoft Internet Explorer and Level 4 Netscape. Netscape 6 will not support many of the features in this essay.</p>
    <p>These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making.</p>
    <h1>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement with the making of web pages and of web policies.</h1>
    <p><a href="https://dashes.com/2012/12/13/the-web-we-lost/">The Web We Lost (2012)</a> , Anil Dash writes: "In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity."</p>
    <h1>In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the provocative headline: <a href="https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet">Millions of Facebook users have no idea they’re using the internet.</a> As the article states: "This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next billion people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves."</h1>
    <p>In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835">The Great Web 1.0 Revival.</a> Its author Kyle Chayka observed:<br>
The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer, and more intimate… We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where everything was smaller...<br>
The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social network <a href="http://tilde.club">TILDE.CLUB</a>, which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For some, <a href="http://tilde.club">TILDE.CLUB</a> serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view a new net art work 640x480 - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, <a href="http://tilde.club">TILDE.CLUB</a> has served as little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain <a href="page4.html">blank.</a></p>
