            <p>Dolphins move together through synchrony, which is a form of coordinated movement that helps them with communication, cooperation, and social bonding. This includes synchronized swimming and breathing, and it is used for various purposes such as coordinating hunts, impressing potential mates, and defending against predators. </p>
