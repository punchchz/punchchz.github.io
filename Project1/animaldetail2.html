        <div class="animal-description">
            <p>Sardines move together by following a few simple rules, coordinating with their immediate neighbors rather than the whole school. They use their lateral line system, which detects water pressure changes, to sense the movement and position of nearby fish. This allows them to simultaneously steer in the average direction of their neighbors, stay close to them, and avoid collisions.</p>
