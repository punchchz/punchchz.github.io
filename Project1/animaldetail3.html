            <p>Jellyfish mostly move together in large groups due to external forces like water currents rather than coordinated social behavior. They are often carried in swarms by the same currents or follow the same food source, although some species like the helmet jellyfish show limited apparent social behavior by syncing their swimming with nearby individuals.</p>
